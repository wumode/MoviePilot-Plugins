      "description": "Funny woman Rachel Sennott is bringing her wonderfully warped sense of humor to HBO Max with a weekly scripted comedy series about an ambitious LA friend group. Created, written, and starring Sennott, the eight-episode season appears to lampoon (and maybe celebrate a little?) Los Angeles’ perpetual hustle culture as its main cast attempts to navigate life and love in La La Land. Not only does the show have an iconic core cast (Odessa A'zion and Josh Hutcherson, <i>hello</i>), it also boasts an impressive roster of guests like Leighton Meester, Quenlin Blackwell, Elijah Wood, and Froy Gutierrez, among others. <i>— Adrienne</i>",

      "description": "With his heart on his sleeve and a devilish grin on his lips, Mexican auteur Guillermo del Toro explained that adapting Mary Shelley’s masterwork into a personal fable of fathers and sons is “like marrying a widow – you have to respect the memory of the late husband. But on Saturday, you gotta party on.” Oscar Isaac plays the bad dad/mad scientist Dr. Victor Frankenstein, while Jacob Elordi absolutely disappears, physically and vocally, into the role of del Toro’s misunderstood monster, whose reanimated tissue is the beating heart of this extremely earnest and epic morality play. Not to mention, the visual spectacle of del Toro’s rip-roaring retelling hits harder than the Creature’s super-powered punches that literally break a man’s back in half during the film’s arctic ass-kicking of an opening. <i>— Alex</i>",

The intriguing premise follows Carol (Rhea Seehorn) as the only person immune to a virus that causes uncontrollable optimism and happiness. With the tagline, The most miserable person on Earth must save the world from happiness, I can't wait to see how this one plays out. I mean, would a world full of happiness and optimism be a bad thing? The series marks a reunion between Gilligan and Better Call Saul star Seehorn, and has been greenlit for two seasons before its debut. Given Gilligan's track record and Apple TV's track record of leaning into high-quality sci-fi programming, my expectations are high for this one.  <i>—Vanessa</i>",

I wasn’t, and the climax left me agog. Sydney Sweeney convincingly bobs in a performance that works so well because of writer/director David Michôd’s subtle skill of loading all the hurt and rage of the real Christy behind Sweeney’s doe-eyes. Life’s incessant body-blows back her into a corner, until she explodes forth with the pent-up anger of a caged animal. Ben Foster could also earn his own much-deserved awards buzz, unless audiences are too repulsed by what might be his most detestable villain role yet.

For me, Season 1 was a touch wan, but I’m not ready to unplug from Kristin Wiig’s scheme to cement her status among the social elite of late ‘60s Palm Beach. Especially if it turns out Patti Lupone is the scene’s true grand dame, ranking higher than Carol Burnett somehow. There’s such a tightness to the show’s scripts and direction throughout Season 1, I wondered what it would be like if Wiig and company just improvised – but I’m rooting for the comedy to coalesce and fully deliver on its promise. Plus Ricky Martin on TV just works for me. <i>— Arno</i>",

Releasing a remake in the current climate feels less sci-fi, more actual-real world. Though to some, the movie might have weird mouthfeel, like a pop manifesto squirted over a popcorn tub. To others: Glen Powell sure looks good in a tight uniform. No doubt director Edgar Wright will deliver stylized action while Powell tries to avoid becoming the latest victim on America’s #1 reality elimination show. But sci-fi remakes are always a dicey proposition, and it’s been a minute since a Stephen King adaptation was a smash (though <i>The Monkey</i> will be in my top five of ‘25). <i>— Arno</i>",

But the acting is top-notch, including an adorably sweet performance from Aidan Delbis, who adds a welcome heart to the pitch black satire. <i>— James</i>",
