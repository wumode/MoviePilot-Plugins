For the third Knives Out film, Daniel Craig’s southern detective will be surrounded by some of the biggest talents in Hollywood, and you’ll forgive us if we name drop just a few. Josh Brolin, Glenn Close, Mila Kunis, Josh O'Connor Kerry Washington, Andrew Scott, and Cailee Spaeny will all contribute to the conundrum at the center of Rian Johnson’s new feature that the trailer has called “the holy grail” of murders. — <i>Adrienne</i>",

Set in 1977 Brazil, Moura stars as a tech expert who seeks refuge in his hometown.

Along the way, she develops a friendship with fellow reenactor and veteran (Callum Turner), who is playing a “terrorist” named Abu Dice. What this description doesn’t capture is the lunacy of watching adults LARP war, complete with mock IEDs, fog-machine mustard gas, fake limbs, and olfactory experiences like “rotting flesh.” Come for the lampooning of the military-industrial complex; stay for the surprisingly touching romance between Shawkat and Turner; and then leave with your mind blown when you realize the Atropia camp is a real part of U.S. military training. — <i>Adrienne</i>",

In <i>Zootopia 2</i>, beloved duo Judy Hopps (Ginnifer Goodwin) and Nick Wilde (Jason Bateman) return for another adventure, this time investigating a mysterious reptilian newcomer who throws their mammalian metropolis into chaos. In addition to Shakira reprising her role as the Zootopian popstar Gazelle, comedian Fortune Feimster and Oscar winner Ke Huy Quan join the cast. <i>— Vanessa</i>",

Olsen and her plucky Afterlife Coordinators, played by Da’Vine Joy Randolph and John Early, are too much fun in this funny, charming, and slightly-too-long romantic comedy. <i>— Alex</i>",
