      "description": "<i> House of Dynamite</i> is a contemporary disaster movie where the only moment’s peace is the thought of Idris Elba as the US president just shooting hoops with after-school program kids. Kathryn Bigelow’s first film in eight years yanks us from that dream back into a nuclear doomsday scenario, one that screenwriter Noah Oppenheim segmented into 18-minute loops where the clock resets in a series of political and military situation rooms. The feasibility factor here makes the film a rough sit, watching expressions of helplessness and shock pass over the faces of people who have dedicated their lives to responding to domestic threats. I didn’t know how to sit in my chair, or what to do as the credits rolled, my popcorn there, barely eaten. <i>— Arno K.</i>",

Margaret Qualley transcends the source material – she, like Odessa Young in <i>Springsteen: Deliver Me from Nowhere</i>, is an amalgamation of women in Hart’s life.

      "description": "Daniel Day-Lewis comes out of retirement for his son, Ronan, who makes his directorial feature debut with this film about a hermit who has retreated to a life in the woods. The father-son duo co-wrote the screenplay, which sees DD-L's recluse visited by his estranged brother from a bruised past. In a rare occurrence, Sean Bean co-stars in a story where his character might actually live through the end credits. <i>— Arno K.</i>",
