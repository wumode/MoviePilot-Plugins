Say it with me: “Six months!“ After the two-year hiatus that kicked off after the devastating finale of the Shibuya Incident arc, this sudden glut fills me with both excitement and dread at the upcoming angst I'm going to endure as the remaining Jujutsu Sorcerers battle to take down Kenjaku and free Satoru Gojo from the Prison Realm. How many more friends will we lose along the way? Can it be none, please? — <i>Vanessa</i>",

We link back up with Pine as he's dispatched to South America to infiltrate the operation of another arms dealer, who also happens to be a criminal descendant of Roper's. Everyone in the cast is hot, including Olivia Colman, who returns to run Pine's home team operation. And I just learned Noah Jupe — who recently starred in <i>Hamnet</i> — plays Roper's son, who is continuing his father's traditions. — <i>Arno</i>",

I'm most excited for the newcomers to the “Star Trek“ universe: Holly Hunter as Captain Nahla Ake, chancellor of Starfleet Academy, and Paul Giamatti as the newest baddie, a half-Klingon named Nus Braka.
